The MC locations are used to estimate the species concentrations in the plasma. Simulation using TORIC shows that with the 3He level &lt;1%, most RF power is absorbed by the 3He ions and the process can generate energetic 3He ions. In mode conversion (MC) flow drive experiment in D(3He) plasma at 8 T, MC waves were also monitored by PCI. The MC ion cyclotron wave (ICW) amplitude and wavenumber kR have been found to correlate with the flow drive force. The MC efficiency, wave-number k of the MC ICW and their dependence on plasma parameters like Te0 have been studied. Based on the experimental observation and numerical study of the dispersion solutions, a hypothesis of the flow drive mechanism has been proposed.","keywords":["Physics","energetic 3He ions","flow drive","ICRF mode conversion","PCI","three-ion species"],"schemaVersion":"https://schema.org/version/3.3","license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Harvard Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dataverse"}}

This is the luminous central dominating source located in the massive and dense molecular clump associated with IRAS 16562$-$3959. The HRLs exhibit Voigt profiles, a strong signature of Stark broadening. We successfully reproduce the observed continuum and HRLs simultaneously using a simple model of a slow ionized wind in local thermodynamic equilibrium, with no need a high-velocity component. The Lorentzian line wings imply electron densities of $5\\times10^7$~cm$^{-3}$ on average. In addition, we detect SO and SO$_2$ emission arising from a compact ($\\sim3000$~AU) molecular core associated with the central young star. The molecular core exhibits a velocity gradient perpendicular to the jet-axis, which we interpret as evidence of rotation. The set of observations toward G345.4938+01.4677 are consistent with it being a young high-mass star associated with a slow photo-ionized wind.","keywords":["Astronomy and Astrophysics","ISM: jets and outflows --- radio continuum: stars --- stars: formation --- IRAS 16562$-$3959 --- G345.4938+01.4677"],"schemaVersion":"https://schema.org/version/3.3","license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Harvard Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dataverse"}}

While we focus on the IMF’s most powerful member – the United States – we abandon the typical “national interest” reasoning in favor of a micro-incentive approach that connects the motivations of U.S. officials at the Fund to domestic politics. We argue that private actors with stakes in IMF policy communicate their goals to members of Congress via the normal political channels - voting and campaign contributions. We test this part of the argument directly. We assume that Congress, by virtue of its formal authority to rule on nearly every aspect of U.S. participation in the IMF, commands the allegiance of U.S. officials at the Fund. Having established a link between private actors and Congress, and Congress and U.S. representatives at the Fund, we test to see if IMF lending decisions are consistent with private actors’ interests.

These rescues were controversial in Congress, where members voted repeatedly to reduce or eliminate the executive’s freedom to engage in them. I analyze these roll calls with an eye toward explaining who opposes and who supports international financial rescues. I argue that the interests of private actors (district constituencies and interest groups) have an important effect on member voting. Following Stolper-Samuelson reasoning, I find that a member is significantly more likely to favor (oppose) rescues as the proportion of high-skilled (low-skilled) workers in a district increases. In addition, I find that campaign contributions from international banks increase the probability that a member will vote in favor of rescues. Overall, the findings suggest that the distributional effects of rescues find expression in Congress and constrain U.S. international financial policymaking.","keywords":[],"citation":["J.

While the Treasury Department manages the day-to-day aspects of US participation in these institutions, Congress retains authority on funding. With the aim of understanding the microincentives of US support for the IFIs, I analyze congressional voting on bills to fund the IFIs. I argue that members of congress are more likely to support a funding increase (1) the more “liberal” their ideology, (2) the larger the share of campaign contributions they get from banks that specialize in international lending, and (3) the larger the share of voters that gain from economic globalization that reside in their districts. Statistical analyses of voting on five IFI funding bills since 1977 provide support for these arguments.","keywords":["International Monetary Fund; World Bank; Multilateral development banks; International financial institutions; United States Congress"],"citation":["Broz, J.

A common rule of thumb is that left-party governments are expected to pursue policies for lower unemployment, but which may cause inflation. Right-party governments are expected to pursue lower inflation policies. How do these expectations shape the inflation forecasts of monetary policy bureaucrats? If there is a mismatch between the policies bureaucrats expect governments to implement and those that they actually do, forecasts will be systematically biased. Using US Federal Reserve Staff'Âs forecasts we test for executive partisan biases. We find that irrespective of actual policy and economic conditions forecasters systematically overestimate future inflation during left-party presidencies and underestimate future inflation during right-party ones. Our findings suggest that partisan heuristics play an important part in monetary policy bureaucrats'Â inflation expectations.","keywords":["inflation forecasting"],"temporalCoverage":["1969/2007"],"schemaVersion":"https://schema.org/version/3.3","license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Harvard Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dataverse"}}
