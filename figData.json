Subsequently, and running parallel to the development of international print media, photography was introduced into different media publications in Majorca, often adopting the term &#39;illustrated magazine&#39;. And the news reports in these general or specialised illustrated publications are precisely where we come across different photographic and/or photojournalism reports on schools and education in general in Majorca, as well as illustrated advertising for education establishments. This article will offer an approach and analysis of the photographic resources contained in the different illustrated magazines on the island from the first three decades of the 20th century. We will also look at the image of schools from the period and the out-of-school education they provided, as well as the possible potential and uses the images represent for didactics in the history of education field.\n\n", "url": "https://figshare.com/articles/RESEARCH_AND_TEACHING_WITH_PHOTOGRAPHS_HISTORICAL_AND_EDUCATIONAL_PHOTOGRAPHY_RESOURCES_IN_ILLUSTRATED_MAGAZINES_MAJORCA_SPAIN_1902-1936_/7102976", "discussionUrl": "https://figshare.com/articles/RESEARCH_AND_TEACHING_WITH_PHOTOGRAPHS_HISTORICAL_AND_EDUCATIONAL_PHOTOGRAPHY_RESOURCES_IN_ILLUSTRATED_MAGAZINES_MAJORCA_SPAIN_1902-1936_/7102976", "sameAs": "https://figshare.com/articles/RESEARCH_AND_TEACHING_WITH_PHOTOGRAPHS_HISTORICAL_AND_EDUCATIONAL_PHOTOGRAPHY_RESOURCES_IN_ILLUSTRATED_MAGAZINES_MAJORCA_SPAIN_1902-1936_/7102976", "version": "1", "keywords": "photography, photojournalism, illustrated magazines, history of education, didactics, Education Policy", "variablesMeasured": "none", "thumbnailUrl": "", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "SciELO journals"}, "creator": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Xavier Motilla Salas"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara González Gómez"}], "distribution": [{"@type": "DataDownload", "contentUrl": "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/13074239", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}]}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.7187228.v1": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Dataset", "@id": "https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7187228.v1", "dateCreated": "2018-10-10T03:05:54Z", "datePublished": "2018-12-01T03:05:52Z", "dateModified": "2018-10-10T03:05:55Z", "name": "Terms of clarification and accountability in the light of intervention bioethics", "description": "\nAbstract In Brazil, access to medicines of the Specialized Pharmaceutical Care Program, within the scope of the Brazilian Unified Health System, depends on filling out and delivering the Clarification and Responsibility Form at specialized pharmacies.

Our findings point to refraction in how Educational Interpreters are characterized and to an attempt to frame their roles in general and specific duties, some of which focus on planning/training and others focus on the classroom routine. Our conclusions suggest that the role of Educational Interpreters is a merger of both interpreting practices and pedagogical activities.\n\n", "url": "https://figshare.com/articles/The_Roles_of_the_Educational_Interpreter_Between_Social_Practices_and_Education_Policies/7215662", "discussionUrl": "https://figshare.com/articles/The_Roles_of_the_Educational_Interpreter_Between_Social_Practices_and_Education_Policies/7215662", "sameAs": "https://figshare.com/articles/The_Roles_of_the_Educational_Interpreter_Between_Social_Practices_and_Education_Policies/7215662", "version": "1", "keywords": "Brazilian Sign Language, Education, Educational Interpreter, Education policy, Linguistics", "variablesMeasured": "none", "thumbnailUrl": "", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "SciELO journals"}, "creator": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Neiva de Aquino Albres"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Carlos Henrique Rodrigues"}], "distribution": [{"@type": "DataDownload", "contentUrl": "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/13285967", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}]}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.7185404.v1": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Dataset", "@id": "https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7185404.v1", "dateCreated": "2018-10-10T02:41:43Z", "datePublished": "2018-12-01T02:41:41Z", "dateModified": "2018-10-10T02:41:46Z", "name": "“Speaking properly”: Language Conceptions Problematized in English Lessons of an Undergraduate Teacher Education Course in Brazil", "description": "Abstract This qualitative research was done in a class of English Oral Practice 2 in an undergraduate English teacher education course in Brazil.
